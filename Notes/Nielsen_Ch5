Nielsen Chapter 5 — Finding Antecedent (Hitomi Hirayama)

-The distance of antecedent in quotational space
	-The antecedent of VPE in the quotational space should be within the quotational space, but it shouldn’t be so close?
	(e.g.) shouldn’t be some intervener between two quotational spaces?
	It doesn’t have to be. The antecedent can be adjacent.

-Nested antecedents
 What we need: Head overlap
	=VPs that contain the actual antecedent
 But doesn’t that mean as long as we can detect the right sentence, we would get something right?

If we evaluate Recency at sentential level…
S [[VP1[..[*VP2*[..[V3 ..]]]]]]
Assume that VP2 is the correct antecedent of VPE.
	-Because they are in the same sentence, VP1, VP2, and VP3 should have the same recency.
	-> We would get 100% Recall in Head Overlap
	-> However, the precision is 33% (1/3)

Well, but if most of the sentences have only one VP inside the sentence, this might not be a serious problem…

However, in the machine learning that Nielsen applied, putting actual recency to nested antecedent provided better results than putting the same recency to them.

-Auxiliary match
 Should the auxiliary of VPE match that of its antecedent?
 -> Not necessarily.
    Adding auxiliary match improved the result a little bit, but not so much

-Subject match
 Nielsen only handled 3rd person subjects — isn’t it easy to handle 1st and 2nd person?
