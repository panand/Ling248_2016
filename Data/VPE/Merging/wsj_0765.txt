1	It has more drug users than Boston has people .
2	Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all .
3	Its tax base is shrinking , a $ 1 billion *U* budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year .
4	This is New York City .
5	When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race *T*-1 , the man most likely * to gain custody of all this is a career politician named * David Dinkins .
6	* Running the nation 's largest and most ornery city may be no treat , but at least Mr. Dinkins knows what *-2 to expect *T*-1 from it .
7	As the campaign hits the home stretch , however , voters still have very little idea what they can expect *T*-1 from him .
8	After 25 years in city politics , David Dinkins remains an enigma .
9	The soft-spoken , silver-haired Manhattan borough president -- the first black man 0 *T*-1 to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here -- does n't have a single prominent political enemy .
10	While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call *T*-1 his own .
11	*-2 Asked *-1 about his greatest achievement in public life , he first speaks about the quality of his staff .
12	Now , as election day nears , even some supporters wonder what he will do *T*-1 if he wins the mayoralty on Nov. 7 .
13	They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies who *T*-1 may seek a place at the trough .
14	They wonder whether he has the economic know-how 0 * to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis *T*-2 , and they wonder who *T*-1 will be advising him .
15	Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who *T*-1 advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that *T*-2 have funneled money into his campaign ?
16	After his decisive primary victory over Mayor Edward I. Koch in September , Mr. Dinkins coasted , until recently , on a quite-comfortable lead over his Republican opponent , Rudolph Giuliani , the former crime buster who *T*-1 has proved a something of a bust as a candidate .
17	But Mr. Dinkins has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who *T*-1 is a convicted kidnapper , and over his handling of a stock sale to his son .
18	Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins 's support among Jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points .
19	In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability * to handle the mayoralty .
20	`` A lot of people think 0 I will give away the store , but I can assure you 0 I will not *?* , '' he says *T*-1 .
21	`` I am aware 0 we have real budgetary problems . ''
22	The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that *T*-1 are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
23	Renewed efforts * to fight drugs and crime will be costly .
24	But city officials say 0 tax revenues are lagging .
25	And after a decade of explosive job growth on Wall Street , a period of contraction is under way .
26	Mr. Koch already has announced 0 he will drop 3,200 jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n't be enough .
27	New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $ 1.3 billion *U* budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year , a gap that *T*-1 could grow if there is a recession .
28	If *-1 elected *-2 , Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but *-1 to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods .
29	`` He is going *-1 to face a mess , '' says *T*-2 City Council President Andrew Stein .
30	`` His supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will be * to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money . ''
31	By and large , Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore *T*-1 .
32	Instead of *-1 focusing on the financial future , Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched * by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated * by Mayor Koch .
33	`` The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people , '' says *T*-1 Meyer Frucher , a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo .
34	`` It is a feel-good candidacy . ''
35	No doubt , Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence .
36	He is an avuncular figure who *T*-1 remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word 0 * to say *T*-3 about anybody .
37	More important , he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged *-1 *T*-2 -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst .
38	Rather than *-1 scaring off white voters , as many predicted 0 he would *?* , Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for * having a cool head .
39	-LRB- * Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority : On humid days this summer , he was known *-1 to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day . -RRB-
40	But even in his front-runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say 0 *T*-1 has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor .
41	Over the last few weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what *T*-1 was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani .
42	A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled * by his political patron Percy Sutton *T*-2 was allowed *-3 to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media .
43	He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
44	His campaign was caught *-1 flat-footed amid allegations 0 it paid almost $ 10,000 *U* for what it said 0 *T*-2 was a `` get-out-the-vote '' effort by black activist Sonny Carson , a convicted kidnapper who later *T*-3 said publicly that he is `` anti-white . ''
45	Critics have said 0 the payment looked like an attempt *ICH*-3 by the Dinkins camp * to get Mr. Carson to stop *-1 leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder -- protests 0 the campaign may have feared 0 *T*-2 could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate .
46	Mr. Dinkins also has failed *-1 to allay Jewish voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has *?* .
47	These campaign problems have echoed difficulties 0 Mr. Dinkins has run into *T*-1 before .
48	A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , *-1 joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , *-1 linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and *-1 getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965 .
49	But his chance * to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame , a plan boosted * by Mr. Sutton , was squandered *-1 because of Mr. Dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- * to file income tax returns for four years running .
50	`` I always thought of this as a thing that *T*-2 could always be done *-1 tomorrow , '' he said *T*-3 at the time .
51	Later , Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols , including then-City Council President Paul O'Dwyer , when they helped him get appointed *-1 city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau , among other things *T*-2 .
52	-LRB- Mr. O'Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for Mr. Sutton 's media company . -RRB-
53	The debt rose further in 1977 when Mr. Sutton resigned his position as Manhattan borough president *-1 to run for mayor *T*-2 .
54	Mr. Sutton recalls : `` When I left *T*-1 , I sat down with Charlie -LCB- Rangel -RCB- , Basil -LCB- Paterson -RCB- and David , and David said , ` Who *T*-2 will run for borough president ? ' And I said , ` You will *?* . ' ''
55	David Garth , Mayor Koch 's longtime media adviser , says of Mr. Dinkins , `` He really is the personification of the patronage system .
56	But the guy is so personally decent , 0 people tend *-1 to forget that . ''
57	Mr. Dinkins lost twice by wide margins before * finally getting elected *-1 borough president in 1985 .
58	But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's Board of Estimate , the body that *T*-1 votes on crucial budget and land-use matters .
59	Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours *T*-1 as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office *-2 to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
60	`` He taught me how * to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m. *T*-2 , I 'll give him that , '' says *T*-1 Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard .
61	Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from * having a say in the way 0 things turned out *T*-1 , critics claim 0 *T*-2 .
62	On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member 0 *T*-1 to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan 's Columbus Circle .
63	But board members say 0 he took so long *-1 to decide how * to vote *T*-2 that by the time 0 he decided *T*-3 , it was too late * to try *-4 to draw other members to his position .
64	Says *ICH*-1 one city official : `` Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal .
65	He would have got a lot more done *-1 if he made up his mind faster . ''
66	One Board member , Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer , was said *-1 to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign .
67	`` I had some problem from time to time on the length of time 0 he would take *T*-1 *-2 to make up his mind , '' Mr. Ferrer admits *T*-3 , but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of Mr. Dinkins and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically .
68	Mr. Dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff , Bill Lynch , denies that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long *-1 to decide important issues .
69	`` We did n't rubber-stamp everything that *T*-1 came to us , '' Mr. Lynch says *T*-2 .
70	On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign *T*-1 , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble .
71	Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested * weakening the law forbidding public employees *-1 to go on strike *T*-2 .
72	He withdrew the remark .
73	When he later sided with striking hospital workers *T*-1 , some allies *ICH*-2 cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees .
74	Then , two days before * receiving an endorsement from environmental groups , Mr. Dinkins promised 0 he would issue a three-year moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator plants .
75	That announcement was roundly criticized *-4 by Mayor Koch -- who *T*-2 has endorsed Mr. Dinkins -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ 5 million *U* *-5 planning for an incinerator that *T*-3 would be scrapped *-1 under Mr. Dinkins 's proposal .
76	While his public statements have at times been confusing , Mr. Dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment .
77	He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes 0 *T*-1 would make it *EXP*-2 more difficult * to attract investment in the city .
78	In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes * linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of * hiring New York City residents .
79	With an untrained local labor pool , many experts believe 0 *T*-1 , that policy could drive businesses from the city .
80	And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of * moving employees out of New York City .
81	Many economic-development officials say 0 the Koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank jobs from * moving across the Hudson .
82	But Mr. Dinkins 's economic planks do n't seem *-1 to bother the business community , where he draws significant support *T*-2 .
83	Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says 0 Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it *T*-1 , he can be reasonable . ''
84	Mr. Dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears *-1 to include both ideologues and pragmatists , * leaving voters with little clue as to who *T*-2 will be more influential .
85	The key man seems *-1 to be the campaign manager , Mr. Lynch .
86	A disheveled , roly-poly son of a Long Island potato farmer , Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer who *T*-1 worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson .
87	But as the Dinkins campaign hit tough times this month , Andrew Cuomo , the politically seasoned son of the New York governor , is also said *-1 to have taken a more active role on strategy .
88	Another close ally is Ruth Messinger , a Manhattan city councilwoman , some of whose programs , such as commercial rent control , *T*-1 have made their way into Mr. Dinkins 's position papers .
89	If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins , as some suggest 0 she will *?* , his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor .
90	But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal , who *T*-1 would head a Dinkins transition team , is more mainstream , as is *?* real-estate executive Anthony Gliedman , another insider .
91	Mr. Dinkins also has said 0 he would receive economic advice from a board that *T*-1 would include American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III , investment banker Felix Rohatyn , leveraged-buy-out specialist Reginald Lewis and attorney Joseph Flom .
92	Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background .
93	Names of possible deputies that *T*-1 have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch , former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs. Leventhal and Gliedman .
94	Then there are Mr. Dinkins 's old-time Harlem colleagues , such as U.S. Rep. Rangel , former Deputy Mayor Paterson and Mr. Sutton .
95	*-3 Having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics ; they are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political community that *T*-2 has been based *-1 largely in Brooklyn .
96	-LRB- Part of Mr. Dinkins 's strength is his ability * to win the support of both the Brooklyn and Harlem factions . -RRB-
97	`` We know 0 there are potholes for the city out there , '' says *T*-1 Mr. Paterson , Mr. Dinkins 's former law partner .
98	`` If any of us think 0 we 're going *-1 to sidetrack David 's determination 0 *T*-2 to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake . ''
99	Adds *ICH*-3 Ms. Messinger , who *T*-1 is expected *-4 to win the borough president 's job 0 Mr. Dinkins is vacating *T*-2 , `` You have *-5 to remember 0 David is a pragmatist . ''
100	But Mr. Dinkins 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination * not to upset the political apple cart .
101	He is taken *-4 aback in an interview when * asked *-1 whether , as mayor , he plans on * reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that *T*-2 perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York 's school system *T*-3 .
102	`` I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? Uh-uh , '' he says *T*-1 with a shake of the head .
103	Despite many doubts about his candidacy , white New Yorkers -- who *T*-1 gave Mr. Dinkins 30 % of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected *-2 to desert in sufficient numbers * to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani .
104	The former U.S. attorney , who *T*-1 prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives , has succeeded in *-2 raising questions about Mr. Dinkins 's ethical standards , but so far has failed *-2 to generate excitement about his own candidacy .
105	As a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city , Mr. Giuliani has an inherent handicap .
106	As a first-time candidate , he has been slow *-1 to learn the nuances of New York City politicking .
107	Mr. Giuliani is finding that Mr. Dinkins , in his many years in public life , has built up considerable good will that so far *T*-1 has led many voters to overlook certain failings .
108	`` The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , '' says *T*-1 Malcolm Hoenlein , a Jewish community leader .
109	`` In the end , I think 0 David will be judged *-1 for *-2 being David .
