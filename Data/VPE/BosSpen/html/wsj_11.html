By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will <font color=green><b>condemn themselves</b></font>, as the Maronites <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1142 (line 32, ant vp):</b><br>

Once she <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.</p>
