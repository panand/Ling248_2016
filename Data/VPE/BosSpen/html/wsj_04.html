Warner and Mr. Azoff <font color=green><b>declined comment</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0408 (line 10, ant vp):</b><br>
Although Mr. Azoff won't <font color=green><b>produce films</b></font> at first, it is possible that he could <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so later, the sources said.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0413 (line 74, ant vp):</b><br>
I<font color=green><b> attend</b></font>, and so <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> a television crew from New York City.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0415 (line 22, ant vped):</b><br>
The dollar, the best indicator of the country's mood, has <font color=green><b>skyrocketed on the parallel market</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> gold.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0415 (line 31, ant vp):</b><br>
If Brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt, this could lead it to <font color=green><b>open up and deregulate its sheltered economy</b></font>, analysts say, just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> even though he was elected on a populist platform.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0423 (line 11, ant vp):</b><br>
Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration <font color=green><b>hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail</b></font>, just as they <font color=blue><b>were</b></font> when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0423 (line 13, ant vp):</b><br>
It's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself, however, to <font color=green><b>say all the same things</b></font>.<br>
In fact, he <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0433 (line 5, ant tv):</b><br>
Do you think the British <font color=green><b>know</b></font> something that we <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't?</p>

According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, New York, "Highland Valley has already <font color=green><b>started operating</b></font> and Cananea is expected to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so soon."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0439 (line 23, ant ap):</b><br>
All independent media activity is now <font color=green><b>illegal</b></font>, which perhaps is not surprising, but so <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0439 (line 46, ant vp):</b><br>
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev <font color=green><b>presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress</b></font>.<br>
In <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0439 (line 49, ant pp):</b><br>
Mr. Gorbachev is <font color=green><b>in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal</b></font> than <font color=blue><b>was</b></font> Mussolini, who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat.</p>

But early on, IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to <font color=green><b>copy it</b></font>.<br>

In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers <font color=green><b>put a greater emphasis on quality and service</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0445 (line 98, ant tv):</b><br>
Toyota Motor Corp. 's sales offices in Japan <font color=green><b>have</b></font> one-tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>; over the next five years, it is aiming for rough parity.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0445 (line 128, ant vp):</b><br>
IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't <font color=green><b>introduce its first PC in Japan</b></font> until five years after NEC <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard.</p>

Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been <font color=green><b>publicly sticking up for the trading strategy</b></font>, as some <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> during the post-crash outcry of 1987.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0453 (line 7, ant tv):</b><br>
Please <font color=green><b>contribute</b></font> what you <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>," the ad said.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0453 (line 46, ant vpng):</b><br>
And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation: "The Red Cross has been <font color=green><b>helping people</b></font> for 125 years.<br>
New York Life has been <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> the same for over 140 years."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0475 (line 28, ant vp):</b><br>
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to <font color=green><b>look at other choices</b></font> and whether they now were asked not <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0485 (line 25, ant ap):</b><br>
"One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not <font color=green><b>distinctive</b></font> but that Bette Midler <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0409 (line 29, ant vp):</b><br>
But even that group knows some people don't <font color=green><b>use their machines as much</b></font> as they <font color=blue><b>should</b></font>. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle. "The second is they don't have enough discipline." With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years, he adds, "a lot of garages, basements and attics must be populated with them."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0445 (line 34, ant vp):</b><br>
Moreover, Japanese offices tend to <font color=green><b>use computers less efficiently</b></font> than American offices <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0449 (line 29, ant ap):</b><br>
Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as <font color=green><b>big an index arbitrager</b></font> as Merrill <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0456 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
He did not <font color=green><b>go as far</b></font> as he could <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> in tax reductions; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0488 (line 41, ant vp):</b><br>
"There is no question that the situation is bad, but we may <font color=green><b>be painting a gloomier picture</b></font> than we <font color=blue><b>should</b></font>," he said.</p>
