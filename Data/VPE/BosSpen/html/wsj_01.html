Assuming that post at the age of 35, he <font color=green><b>managed by consensus</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0103 (line 17, ant vped):</b><br>
A USX spokesman said the company hadn't yet <font color=green><b>received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine</b></font>. "Once we <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said. "No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0112 (line 14, ant vp):</b><br>
The framers hardly <font color=green><b>discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787</b></font>, according to Madison's notes.<br>

<p><b>wsj_0112 (line 45, ant vp):</b><br>
President Bush should <font color=green><b>veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives</b></font>.<br>
If President Bush fails to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0112 (line 67, ant vpng):</b><br>
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be <font color=green><b>disappointing</b></font>, as Morrison v.<br>
Olson <font color=blue><b>was</b></font> for the Reagan administration.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0112 (line 68, ant ap):</b><br>
But the presidency would be no <font color=green><b>worse off</b></font> than it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> now.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0112 (line 73, ant vp):</b><br>
President Bush should <font color=green><b>set things straight</b></font>.<br>
If he <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> not, he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature "everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0113 (line 34, ant ap):</b><br>
Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as <font color=green><b>good a year</b></font> as 1988 <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0114 (line 24, ant vp):</b><br>
Many felt Hearst <font color=green><b>kept the paper alive as long</b></font> as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>, if marginally, because of its place in family history.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0114 (line 48, ant vp):</b><br>
His wife also <font color=green><b>works for the paper</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> his father.</p>

The banks have 28 days to <font color=green><b>file an appeal against the ruling</b></font> and are expected to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so shortly.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0118 (line 129, ant tv):</b><br>
Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders <font color=green><b>currently enjoy in the marketplace</b></font> that other investors <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0118 (line 194, ant ap):</b><br>
In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much <font color=green><b>higher</b></font> than it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> today.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0121 (line 6, ant vped):</b><br>
But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be <font color=green><b>halted entirely</b></font>, and a surprising number doubt it should <font color=blue><b>be</b></font>.</p>

Mahoney, a Moody's vice president. "A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible." Standard & Poor's Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead.</p>
