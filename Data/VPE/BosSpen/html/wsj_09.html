Not all the scandal-tripped have <font color=green><b>enjoyed soft landings</b></font>.<br>
But many <font color=blue><b>have</b></font>. "These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people," says Washington writer Suzanne Garment, who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0909 (line 29, ant ap):</b><br>
"He's as <font color=green><b>busy</b></font> as he <font color=blue><b>was</b></font> as speaker," reports Mr. Wright's administrative aide, Larry Shannon.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0909 (line 110, ant vp):</b><br>
If the political establishment is reluctant to <font color=green><b>forgive sexual misadventures</b></font>, the private sector sometimes <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0922 (line 20, ant np):</b><br>
In part, this division is dictated by economics: West Germany is <font color=green><b>a net exporter of capital</b></font> while the U.S. <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0931 (line 22, ant vp):</b><br>
But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger." He says that the Chinese never asked him to <font color=green><b>convey their statements to President Bush</b></font>, but that the White House spontaneously invited him to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0934 (line 45, ant vped):</b><br>
It isn't yet clear whether the 200-ruble limit will be <font color=green><b>lifted</b></font>.<br>
If it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>n't, the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0936 (line 37, ant vped):</b><br>
In an interview with the Washington Post in early October, the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more <font color=green><b>interested in curbing inflation</b></font> than the administration <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0937 (line 22, ant vp):</b><br>
All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to <font color=green><b>go into high public dudgeon</b></font>, as Mr. Apple and I <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> the other night on ABC's "Nightline." Punching away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0937 (line 38, ant vp):</b><br>
And if you are caught or if people complain, simply argue that "everyone <font color=green><b>does it</b></font>" or "no one said I <font color=blue><b>should</b></font>n't " and brazen it out.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0946 (line 20, ant vp):</b><br>

It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to <font color=green><b>have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy</b></font>.<br>
Certainly I <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> not.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0946 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to <font color=green><b>caricature as "the war between the sexes."</b></font> But although Thurber <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0946 (line 35, ant vp):</b><br>
The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen <font color=green><b>read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts</b></font> as other people in the area <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0955 (line 48, ant vp):</b><br>
They worry that Mr. Breeden also will <font color=green><b>roll over</b></font> when told to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so by the White House.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0961 (line 3, ant vp):</b><br>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can <font color=green><b>wipe out inflation without causing a recession</b></font>, but he said <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0964 (line 32, ant vp):</b><br>
-- Allow the EPA to <font color=green><b>permit the continued use of pesticides</b></font> that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> so outweigh the cost.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0966 (line 8, ant vp):</b><br>
As the session broke up, I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university. "I'd <font color=green><b>love to see sports cut back</b></font>, and so <font color=blue><b>would</b></font> a lot of my counterparts at other schools, but everybody's afraid to make the first move," he confided. "It's like the U.S. and the Russians: Nobody wants to disarm first."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0966 (line 39, ant vp):</b><br>
Dean Steinkuhler, a spectacularly bulked-up former lineman, confesses that he <font color=green><b>used 'em</b></font>, and says other Huskers <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> too.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0966 (line 41, ant vped):</b><br>
It's a mystery how this could have <font color=green><b>escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches</b></font>.<br>
Probably, it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0968 (line 24, ant vpng):</b><br>
Analysts said the company's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores, allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are <font color=green><b>selling</b></font> and those that <font color=blue><b>are</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0972 (line 21, ant vp):</b><br>
All of their friends <font color=green><b>have children</b></font> and they <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>'t, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0978 (line 30, ant vp):</b><br>
So why does Renaissance's computer <font color=green><b>like stocks</b></font> with the Dow at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday, when it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>n't with the Dow at 2200?</p>
<p><b>wsj_0985 (line 15, ant ap):</b><br>
Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as <font color=green><b>unsuccessful</b></font> for the Soviets as it <font color=blue><b>was</b></font> for the czars.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0989 (line 50, ant vp):</b><br>
So far, they say, it hasn't <font color=green><b>had any noticeable effect on response rates</b></font>.<br>
And before it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0992 (line 11, ant vp):</b><br>
<font color=green><b>Call it anecdotal</b></font> if you <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0994 (line 41, ant np):</b><br>
"Traffic is certainly <font color=green><b>a concern</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0994 (line 58, ant vp):</b><br>
Will the investments <font color=green><b>pay off</b></font>?<br>
The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0909 (line 36, ant vp):</b><br>
The former $3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics. "I <font color=green><b>feel better</b></font> than I ever <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> in my life," he says.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0918 (line 14, ant vped):</b><br>
The dividend increase was Du Pont's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders.

<p><b>wsj_0946 (line 41, ant vp):</b><br>
The Morgan case thus <font color=green><b>tells us much</b></font> more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0985 (line 8, ant vp):</b><br>
By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to <font color=green><b>revoke payment whenever it chose</b></font>, much as it <font color=blue><b>would</b></font> in today's Soviet Union.</p>
