As they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers <font color=green><b>for the most part teach in English</b></font>, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0819 (line 52, ant vped):</b><br>
Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," <font color=green><b>helped a lot</b></font>, but so <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board.</p>

But Sony also says in its filing that the Warner contract "doesn't require that Guber and Peters <font color=green><b>take any affirmative steps to produce motion pictures</b></font>; it simply rewards them when they <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> and prohibits them from producing for another entertainment company." And Sony says Warner has already shown it doesn't need the producers "by taking action to prevent Guber and Peters from completing production in Warner properties."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0839 (line 22, ant vp):</b><br>
Among the arguments Sony makes is that Warner should let the producers <font color=green><b>go to Columbia</b></font> because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held Barris Industries Inc., which earlier this year changed its name to Guber Peters Entertainment.<br>
Sony also says in its filing that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters were offered management posts at Columbia once before in 1987, and that "Warner approved and encouraged them to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so."</p>

Goodwill planned to <font color=green><b>sell the property and pocket the proceeds</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>had</b></font> in many similar cases.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0846 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani refused to say whether Indosuez will <font color=green><b>bid for all of Morgan Grenfell</b></font> when its year is up.<br>
If it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, the operation would be one of the largest foreign purchases of a U.K merchant bank.</p>

Only nine ESP contracts traded on the Big Board -- equivalent to about one million shares of stock, with a value of about $45 million. "It was <font color=green><b>a slow start</b></font>, but we expected it would <font color=blue><b>be</b></font>," said Big Board President Richard Grasso. "We were generally pleased with the way the systems acted."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0860 (line 33, ant vp):</b><br>
"We haven't decided to <font color=green><b>blacklist any firms</b></font>.<br>
But there's a chance we <font color=blue><b>might</b></font>," said David Wilson, head of Penn Mutual's $100 million stock portfolio. "We are very upset about what has happened to the stock market.</p>

Goldman, which doesn't <font color=green><b>do index arbitrage</b></font> for itself but <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> for customers, is concerned about the fallout. "Our corporate, institutional and individual clients are concerned about what they perceive to be excessive volatility," said Robert E. Mnuchin, senior partner in charge of Goldman's equity trading. "We share their concern.</p>

Neil Kinnock, Labor Party leader, dubbed the 46-year-old Mr. Major a "lap dog" unlikely to <font color=green><b>veer from his boss's strongly held views</b></font>, as Mr. Lawson sometimes <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0883 (line 40, ant vped):</b><br>
As she has <font color=blue><b>done</b></font> in the past, she <font color=green><b>stated her support for Mr. Lawson</b></font> but insisted on keeping on an adviser who opposed and disparaged his policies.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0887 (line 19, ant vp):</b><br>
The shortcomings of delaying the reward, as Sen. Roth and Sen. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) propose, is that it may not <font color=green><b>boost savings much</b></font> and, if it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, it may widen deficits in the future. "It looks like you haven't given anything away, but five, 10, 20, 40 years later, little bomblets go off," says Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0887 (line 24, ant vp):</b><br>
Republican senators, unwilling to concede the popular IRA issue to Democrats, suddenly <font color=green><b>embraced a scheme Sen. Roth had been pressing with little success</b></font>.<br>
The Bush administration, which was planning to unveil an IRA proposal of its own next year, was quick to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> the same.</p>

"The offer will be <font color=green><b>sweetened</b></font>, not because it has to <font color=blue><b>be</b></font>, but because it will make for a smoother transaction," Mr. Thorp said. "Dow Jones could bludgeon its way through the process and get it for less, but they won't do that.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0888 (line 38, ant vp):</b><br>
Dow Jones is not going to <font color=green><b>squeeze as hard</b></font> as it <font color=blue><b>could</b></font>."</p>
