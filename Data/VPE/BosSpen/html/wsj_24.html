<h1>WSJ section 24 (25 cases)</h1>
<p><b>wsj_2400 (line 24, ant vp):</b><br>
A rebound in energy prices, which <font color=green><b>helped push up the producer price index</b></font>, is expected to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> the same in the consumer price report.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2400 (line 27, ant vp):</b><br>
Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level. "Auto prices <font color=green><b>had a big effect</b></font> in the PPI, and at the CPI level they <font color=blue><b>wo</b></font>n't," he said.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2406 (line 14, ant vp):</b><br>
While the network currently can <font color=green><b>operate freely in Budapest</b></font>, so <font color=blue><b>can</b></font> others.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2412 (line 16, ant vp):</b><br>
People eager to have youth "pay their dues to society" <font color=green><b>favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones</b></font>.<br>
So <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2412 (line 58, ant ap):</b><br>
Encouragement is <font color=green><b>fine</b></font>; compulsion <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> not.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2412 (line 74, ant ap):</b><br>
Are they <font color=green><b>worth that</b></font>?<br>
Evaluations suggest that good ones <font color=blue><b>are</b></font> -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2413 (line 5, ant vp):</b><br>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to <font color=green><b>inject massive amounts of money into the banking system</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2415 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
Even for people who <font color=green><b>expect a bear market in coming months</b></font> -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> -- the advice is: Wait for the market to bounce back, and sell shares gradually during rallies.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2418 (line 41, ant vp):</b><br>
Sony <font color=green><b>uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow</b></font> -- and so <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ("To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney.)</p>
<p><b>wsj_2428 (line 23, ant vp):</b><br>
Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins. "You've either <font color=green><b>got a chair</b></font> or you <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2443 (line 73, ant vp):</b><br>
Ramada has said it hopes to <font color=green><b>propose a new restructuring plan</b></font> but hasn't indicated when it will <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2443 (line 90, ant vped):</b><br>
But the stock market as a whole, <font color=green><b>bolstered</b></font> as it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> by takeover speculation, remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers, both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2446 (line 11, ant tv):</b><br>
I want to <font color=green><b>say</b></font> in the most forceful way I <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>: I certainly hope so."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2446 (line 42, ant vp):</b><br>
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should <font color=green><b>hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation</b></font>, as was <font color=blue><b>done</b></font> in the case of former House Speaker James Wright.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2451 (line 30, ant np):</b><br>
That's <font color=green><b>the problem</b></font>, <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>n't it?"</p>
<p><b>wsj_2451 (line 32, ant np):</b><br>
That's <font color=green><b>the problem</b></font>, isn't it?"<br>
Indeed it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2454 (line 33, ant vp):</b><br>
If it doesn't <font color=green><b>yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC</b></font>, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest.<br>
If it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2454 (line 36, ant vp):</b><br>
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships <font color=green><b>leads to increased anti-government protests and violence</b></font>; if it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2455 (line 20, ant vp):</b><br>
Just as Pope John Paul II <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to <font color=green><b>tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2455 (line 46, ant vpng):</b><br>
It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep <font color=green><b>hammering for more open trade policies</b></font>, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in Seoul last week.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2472 (line 82, ant tv):</b><br>
When a store keeps dropping prices, the Farmington, Mich., resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to <font color=green><b>get</b></font> the most they <font color=blue><b>can</b></font> out of you."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2478 (line 42, ant tved):</b><br>
Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bradford said, "We haven't <font color=green><b>seen</b></font> the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should <font color=blue><b>have</b></font>." Flat rolled steel is the industry's major product.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2491 (line 24, ant vp):</b><br>
But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull <font color=green><b>remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s</b></font>.<br>
To <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2495 (line 6, ant vp):</b><br>
Nor <font color=green><b>mistake</b></font>, as he seems to have <font color=blue><b>done</b></font>, a raw, rough-cut, unretouched, genuine diary, complete with blips, print lice and all the confusions of real time with high-gloss footnoted academic scholarship.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2497 (line 15, ant ap):</b><br>
Are <font color=green><b>narrow</b></font>,<br>
Must they always <font color=blue><b>be</b></font></p>
