<p><b>wsj_2201 (line 6, ant vpng):</b><br>
Their mission is to keep clients from <font color=green><b>fleeing the market</b></font>, as individual investors <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in droves after the crash in October</p>
<p><b>wsj_2201 (line 14, ant vpng):</b><br>
It considered <font color=green><b>running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast</b></font> but decided not <font color=blue><b>to</b></font> when the market recovered yesterday.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2201 (line 50, ant vpng):</b><br>
In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly <font color=green><b>moving faster to create new ads</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in the fall of 1987.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2202 (line 3, ant vp):</b><br>
You <font color=green><b>know what the law of averages is</b></font>, <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't you?</p>
<p><b>wsj_2205 (line 50, ant vp):</b><br>
"France opened the limit down, off at least 10% if you could <font color=green><b>calculate the index</b></font>, which you <font color=blue><b>could</b></font>n't," Mr. Clark, the Shearson trader, said early in the afternoon. "Spain is down 10% and suspended, Sweden's down 8%, Norway 11%.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2229 (line 41, ant vp):</b><br>
If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will <font color=green><b>recognize these problems more quickly and accurately</b></font> than <font color=blue><b>will</b></font> policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2230 (line 68, ant vp):</b><br>
She pointed out that even after Monday's 10% decline, the Straits Times index is up 24% this year, so investors who <font color=green><b>bailed out</b></font> generally <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> so profitably.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2232 (line 38, ant vp):</b><br>
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would <font color=green><b>hold off until the market stabilized</b></font>.<br>
They <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2232 (line 43, ant vp):</b><br>
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it <font color=green><b>shot upward</b></font> it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> so even faster than the early-morning fall.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2233 (line 6, ant np):</b><br>
A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was <font color=green><b>a "frivolous" case</b></font>.<br>
Of course it <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2237 (line 7, ant vp):</b><br>
Maybe after the staffers <font color=green><b>explain their work to the Poles</b></font>, they'd be willing to come back and <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> the same for the American people.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2265 (line 57, ant pp):</b><br>
The LME stocks decline was about <font color=green><b>as expected</b></font>, but the Comex gain <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2282 (line 26, ant vp):</b><br>
Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will <font color=green><b>work</b></font> at Barry Wright as it <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> at Applied.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2282 (line 33, ant vp):</b><br>
When he came to Applied, "I didn't <font color=green><b>have the power to execute</b></font> as I <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> today," he says.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2284 (line 24, ant ap):</b><br>
Though the Panzhihua factory itself is <font color=green><b>profitable</b></font>, many such enterprises <font color=blue><b>are</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2284 (line 78, ant vp):</b><br>
There are few prospects for upward mobility, and Mr. Li's daughter, seven-year-old Li Shu, is certain to <font color=green><b>toil at the factory</b></font> too someday, as <font color=blue><b>are</b></font> more than 10,000 of the workers' children.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2284 (line 112, ant vp):</b><br>
While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily <font color=green><b>quit to find jobs elsewhere</b></font>.<br>
The Li family could apply for permission to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2285 (line 9, ant vp):</b><br>
Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to <font color=green><b>inject massive amounts of money into the banking system</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in October 1987.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2285 (line 47, ant tv):</b><br>
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. "With the market being up to 2,700 or 2,800 and the existence of derivative products . . . one can <font color=green><b>expect</b></font> volatility of the magnitude we <font color=blue><b>had</b></font>."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2286 (line 15, ant np):</b><br>
Those sound like <font color=green><b>innocuous changes</b></font>, but they<font color=blue><b>'re</b></font> not.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2286 (line 27, ant vp):</b><br>
Enough inflation can ultimately even <font color=green><b>wipe out the bond market</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2286 (line 36, ant vp):</b><br>
Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to <font color=green><b>kill inflation</b></font>, which was reaching dangerous levels.<br>
He <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2286 (line 45, ant vp):</b><br>
The claim that inflation <font color=green><b>generates economic growth</b></font> is seductive.<br>
In fact it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> the opposite.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2289 (line 78, ant vp):</b><br>
The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to <font color=green><b>make capital available to dealers if needed</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2293 (line 16, ant vpng):</b><br>
The reasons include the obvious differences in the market between this fall and 1987: Interest rates haven't been <font color=green><b>rising</b></font> this time, as they <font color=blue><b>were</b></font> in 1987; the dollar, though hit Friday, hasn't been eroding dangerously; the economy isn't overheating; and, above all, stocks are far from being as wildly overpriced: They are selling at only about 13 times per-share earnings, compared with about 20 two years ago.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2293 (line 97, ant vp):</b><br>
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can <font color=green><b>fall as fast</b></font> as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2296 (line 31, ant vp):</b><br>
If foreigners <font color=green><b>dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets</b></font> -- as they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies.</p>
