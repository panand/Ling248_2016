Either one <font color=green><b>likes it</b></font> or one <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2106 (line 13, ant vp):</b><br>
Either one <font color=green><b>likes it</b></font> or one doesn't.<br>
The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2109 (line 13, ant pp):</b><br>
People didn't believe we were <font color=green><b>in tune with the marketplace</b></font>, and in many ways we <font color=blue><b>were</b></font>n't."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2109 (line 19, ant vp):</b><br>
But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial <font color=green><b>died</b></font>, so too <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> some advertiser interest.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2109 (line 32, ant vpng):</b><br>
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than <font color=green><b>spreading ads out among its articles</b></font>, as most magazines <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2111 (line 37, ant vp):</b><br>
By 1982, however, the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed, permitting Dictaphone to <font color=green><b>develop its own competitive micro system</b></font>, which it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2112 (line 15, ant vp):</b><br>
The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed to <font color=green><b>analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act's six points, Cap Weinberger's seven points, the Intelligence Committee's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support</b></font>.<br>
So far no one <font color=blue><b>has</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2112 (line 81, ant vp):</b><br>
Then the whole thing will start to <font color=green><b>collapse</b></font>, just as it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in the 1970s, and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people's hair white.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2113 (line 36, ant vp):</b><br>
Collectors don't say "It's a van Gogh" anymore, laments Harry Brooks, the president of Wildenstein & Co., a New York gallery. "They say, `Johnny Payson got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine. ' The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting. . . ." Mr. Payson, an art dealer and collector, sold Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" at a Sotheby's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond. (Trouble is, Mr. Bond has yet to <font color=green><b>pay up</b></font>, and until he <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key.)</p>
<p><b>wsj_2142 (line 19, ant vp):</b><br>
And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to <font color=green><b>dump stocks to raise cash</b></font>, as some <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> during Black Monday.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2145 (line 5, ant vpng):</b><br>
In the wake of Friday's plunge and yesterday's rebound, some companies are already <font color=green><b>postponing deals</b></font>, and others wish they <font color=blue><b>could</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2145 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
Officers of the company, a health-care concern, "were very discouraged on Friday and felt they shouldn't <font color=green><b>go public</b></font>; we felt they <font color=blue><b>should</b></font>," says Sanford Robertson, partner in the banking concern.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2145 (line 45, ant vp):</b><br>
William O'Donnell, president, says he still thinks the IPO will <font color=green><b>succeed</b></font>.<br>
If it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>n't, he says, the company would have to change its expansion timetable.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2149 (line 26, ant vp):</b><br>
You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: "For all its sad associations, whenever I <font color=green><b>recall that evening</b></font> today, I find I <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2167 (line 9, ant vp):</b><br>
Ms. Parks's mother also gets to <font color=green><b>cuff Mr. Alexander</b></font>.<br>
So <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> Mr. Friend and his law partner, Nick Nichols.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2167 (line 25, ant vpng):</b><br>
However, he acknowledges they "have the option of <font color=green><b>taking a swat at me</b></font> if they really want <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>." Mr. Friend says his side is "dead serious." Although they don't contemplate delivering any disabling blows, he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability, just in case.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2173 (line 28, ant vp):</b><br>
Those cuts, known as a "sequester" in budget jargon, became permanent yesterday, although Congress could <font color=green><b>cancel or rescind them</b></font> whenever it wants <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2173 (line 48, ant vp):</b><br>
Under the law, President Bush may <font color=green><b>exempt military personnel accounts from the spending cuts</b></font>.<br>
He hasn't yet <font color=blue><b>done</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2175 (line 19, ant vp):</b><br>
Retailers' sales <font color=green><b>increased 0.7%</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> their inventories.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2183 (line 11, ant vp):</b><br>
Proposition 103 does not prohibit any use of territorial rating, but requires insurers to <font color=green><b>justify it scientifically</b></font>.<br>
So far, they've been unable to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2191 (line 9, ant vp):</b><br>
However, Mr. Smith said that as a result of a $70 billion factory-modernization program undertaken over the last decade, "we can <font color=green><b>produce</b></font> more in the new plants than we <font color=blue><b>could</b></font> in the old plants."</p>
<p><b>wsj_2193 (line 14, ant vp):</b><br>
On Friday, the market makers, who must be prepared to <font color=green><b>buy stock</b></font> when no one else <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>, were frantically cutting the prices at which they would take stocks off sellers' hands, in reaction to plunging prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Mr. Rosenbach.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2194 (line 9, ant vped):</b><br>
The text of his remarks hasn't been <font color=green><b>published</b></font>, and editors say they have no instructions as to whether it will <font color=blue><b>be</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2198 (line 42, ant vped):</b><br>
The past two trading days, while painful, haven't been as disastrous for the arbs as the October 1987 market crash because takeover-related stocks haven't <font color=green><b>dropped as sharply</b></font> as they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> two years ago, and traders aren't as deeply in debt as they were then.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2109 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
Even though National Geographic <font color=green><b>offers far more readers</b></font> than <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> a magazine like Smithsonian, "the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency,"says Harry Glass, New York media manager for Bozell Inc.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2109 (line 29, ant vp):</b><br>
But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions, and until last year <font color=green><b>offered fewer of them</b></font> than <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> competitors.</p>
<p><b>wsj_2195 (line 5, ant vp):</b><br>
You <font color=green><b>sunk just about as low</b></font> as NBC <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> in its reporting on Korean life during last year's Olympics.</p>
