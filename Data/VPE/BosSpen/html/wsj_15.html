"Shippers are saying `the party's over, '" said Mr. LaLonde. "Shippers won't be able to <font color=green><b>look for transportation-cost savings</b></font> as they <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> for the last eight or nine years.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1502 (line 34, ant vped):</b><br>
And "shippers are getting the feeling that they have <font color=green><b>played one trucker off against another as much</b></font> as they <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>," he said.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1542 (line 7, ant ap):</b><br>
The FDA requested the recall of Quantum's mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said, the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much <font color=green><b>larger</b></font> than it actually <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1549 (line 41, ant np):</b><br>
Barbara Donovan, an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich, says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image, but she doubts he's <font color=green><b>a true reformer</b></font>.<br>
Even if he <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>, she adds, he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1560 (line 29, ant vped):</b><br>
And Mr. Jackson probably has <font color=green><b>opened new checking accounts</b></font>, too.<br>
Or at least he <font color=blue><b>should</b></font>. "I assume those accounts are closed," says Mr. Smalling, referring to the accounts of the canceled checks. "I don't think he'd want to give out his current account numbers."</p>
<p><b>wsj_1562 (line 56, ant tv):</b><br>
One-Cancels-The-Other Order: This is really two orders in one, generally for the same security or commodity, instructing floor brokers to <font color=green><b>fill</b></font> whichever order they <font color=blue><b>can</b></font> first and then cancel the other order.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1564 (line 72, ant vp):</b><br>
And returns on cash investments may continue to <font color=green><b>exceed inflation by a wider margin</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> over the long-term past.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1566 (line 48, ant vpng):</b><br>
But with every step I take, I'm <font color=green><b>building wealth</b></font>.<br>
You <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1567 (line 25, ant vp):</b><br>
What's more, the losses they and the others caused "are just what we are stumbling over," says Mr. Stapf, adding that the majority of misdeeds probably <font color=green><b>go undetected</b></font>.<br>
So <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1567 (line 113, ant ap):</b><br>
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies: If it sounds <font color=green><b>too good to be true</b></font>, it probably <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1569 (line 30, ant vp):</b><br>
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't <font color=green><b>grow</b></font> when you need them <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1569 (line 99, ant vpng):</b><br>
But buyers are essentially <font color=green><b>betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record</b></font> -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1570 (line 64, ant tv):</b><br>
Many workers, especially professionals, want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to <font color=green><b>deduct</b></font> many expenses that employees <font color=blue><b>can</b></font>'t.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1570 (line 66, ant vpng):</b><br>
Firms that are <font color=green><b>paying employment taxes</b></font> also provide leads to competitors that <font color=blue><b>are</b></font>n't, he says.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1570 (line 73, ant vp):</b><br>
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none <font color=green><b>tracks them down</b></font> with more relish than <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> New York since it acquired an $80 million computer system in 1985.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1571 (line 21, ant vpng):</b><br>
One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage" category as perhaps <font color=green><b>making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race</b></font>.<br>
Perhaps it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1572 (line 26, ant vp):</b><br>
While the promises of big profits ought to <font color=green><b>set off warning bells</b></font>, they often <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't, in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1574 (line 38, ant vp):</b><br>
<font color=green><b>Sounds great</b></font> -- or <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> it?</p>
<p><b>wsj_1574 (line 43, ant vp):</b><br>
Third and most important, Amex would <font color=green><b>charge me a far higher premium</b></font> than other reputable companies <font color=blue><b>would</b></font> on a straight term policy for the same amount; I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1574 (line 71, ant vp):</b><br>
Congress <font color=green><b>closed this loophole</b></font> last year, or thought it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1574 (line 88, ant vpng):</b><br>
Another factor to consider: Some of the companies currently <font color=green><b>earning very high yields</b></font> are <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> so through substantial investment in junk bonds, and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1578 (line 27, ant vped):</b><br>
Among other stocks <font color=green><b>involved in restructurings</b></font> or rumored to <font color=blue><b>be</b></font> so: Holiday Corp. gained 1 7/8 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 7/8 to 81 1/2.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1586 (line 68, ant ap):</b><br>
And those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages. "The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs {in the U.S.} is not as <font color=green><b>available</b></font> as it <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>," says Mr. Schreibman, who is starting overseas production.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1591 (line 9, ant vp):</b><br>
An Olivetti spokesman said the company's factories are already beginning to produce the machine, and that it should be available in Europe by December. "What this means is that Europeans will <font color=green><b>have these machines in their offices</b></font> before Americans <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>," the spokesman said.</p>
