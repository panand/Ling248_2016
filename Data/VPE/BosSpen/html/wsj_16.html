As a result, many economists were expecting the consumer price index to <font color=green><b>increase</b></font> significantly more than it <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1618 (line 4, ant vp):</b><br>

<p><b>wsj_1618 (line 12, ant vp):</b><br>
It may seem trivial to <font color=green><b>worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday's quake</b></font>, but the name of this column is "On Sports," so I feel obliged to <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>

One fan, seated several rows in front of the open, upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed, faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted, "We arranged that just for you guys!"

<p><b>wsj_1631 (line 53, ant ap):</b><br>
And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be <font color=green><b>riskier investments</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>were</b></font>.</p>

On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts."

First, why ticket splitting has increased and <font color=green><b>taken</b></font> the peculiar pattern that it <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1695 (line 32, ant np):</b><br>
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate <font color=green><b>the specific benefits that the legislator wins</b></font> for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> likewise for his own constituency.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1698 (line 27, ant vp):</b><br>
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really <font color=green><b>get crazy</b></font>, as they <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> now.</p>

They are worth more because they <font color=green><b>pay higher interest</b></font> than newly issued bonds <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>.</p>

He also had to <font color=green><b>fight harder for credibility</b></font> than his partner <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>.</p>

In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has <font color=green><b>captured a greater percentage</b></font> of the major-party popular vote for president than it <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.</p>
<p><b>wsj_1695 (line 51, ant vp):</b><br>
