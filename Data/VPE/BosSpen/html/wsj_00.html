Not only is development of the new company's initial machine <font color=green><b>tied directly to Mr. Cray</b></font>, so <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> its balance sheet.</p>

Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company. "It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc., Minneapolis. "Cray Computer will be a concept stock," he said. "You either <font color=green><b>believe Seymour can do it again</b></font> or you <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't."</p>

They also said that vendors were <font color=green><b>delivering goods more quickly</b></font> in October than they <font color=blue><b>had</b></font> for each of the five previous months.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0037 (line 45, ant vped):</b><br>
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have <font color=green><b>learned something</b></font>, and it's even possible Mr. Morita would <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> too.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0039 (line 10, ant vped):</b><br>
Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would <font color=green><b>be called a homeless person</b></font>.<br>
So <font color=blue><b>would</b></font> the Little Tramp, for that matter.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0039 (line 13, ant vp):</b><br>
Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that <font color=green><b>tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely</b></font> than intertitles, or even words, <font color=blue><b>would</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0039 (line 21, ant vpng):</b><br>
He spends his days <font color=green><b>sketching passers-by</b></font>, or trying <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0039 (line 32, ant vp):</b><br>
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane <font color=green><b>had as strong a presence</b></font> in front of the camera as he <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> behind it.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0041 (line 62, ant vp):</b><br>
Mr. Wilder did <font color=green><b>introduce such legislation 17 years ago</b></font>, but he <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0043 (line 49, ant vpng):</b><br>
Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is <font color=green><b>pumping far more assistance into the region</b></font> than the U.S. <font color=blue><b>is</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0044 (line 31, ant vp):</b><br>
A 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school-research group, concluded that "outright cheating by American educators" is "common." The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often "<font color=green><b>teach the test</b></font>" as Mrs. Yeargin <font color=blue><b>did</b></font>, although most are never caught.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0044 (line 42, ant vp):</b><br>
Experts say there isn't another state in the country where tests <font color=green><b>mean as much</b></font> as they <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0045 (line 43, ant tved):</b><br>
In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High <font color=green><b>concentrated on</b></font> the same sounds that the test <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know.</p>

Judge Ramirez, 44, said it is unjust for judges to <font color=green><b>make</b></font> what they <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>. "Judges are not getting what they deserve.</p>

And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew "Cosby." Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has "been a major disappointment to us." "At the prices we were charged, there should have been <font color=green><b>some return for the dollar</b></font>.<br>
There <font color=blue><b>was</b></font>n't."</p>

Spain's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released only in its 10th year) is <font color=green><b>$70</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> Australia's Grange Hermitage 1982.</p>

But consumers who buy at this level are also more <font color=green><b>knowledgeable</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>were</b></font> a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. "Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range.</p>

Image has, of course, a great deal to do with what <font color=green><b>sells</b></font> and what <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>n't, and it can't be forced.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0071 (line 68, ant ap):</b><br>
By January it should be fairly clear what's <font color=green><b>hot</b></font> -- and what<font color=blue><b>'s</b></font> not.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0072 (line 3, ant vp):</b><br>
Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to <font color=green><b>cut short-term interest rates</b></font>, but it isn't clear whether the central bank will <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> so.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0072 (line 11, ant vp):</b><br>
Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. "I think the market had been expecting the Fed to <font color=green><b>ease sooner and a little more</b></font> than it <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> to date," said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0083 (line 53, ant vped):</b><br>
Adds Mitsui's Mr. Klauser: "Unlike corporations in this country, trading companies aren't so <font color=green><b>much interested in a high return</b></font> on investment as they <font color=blue><b>are</b></font> on increasing trade flows.</p>

The program-trading issue is <font color=green><b>heating up</b></font> on Capitol Hill as it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.</p>

The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels <font color=green><b>stop to chat at the church door</b></font>, as members here always <font color=blue><b>have</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0089 (line 27, ant vpng):</b><br>
The less complicated version of <font color=green><b>playing tunes on bells</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.</p>

Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn't as <font color=green><b>troublesome</b></font> as it might have <font color=blue><b>been</b></font> in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0090 (line 44, ant vpng):</b><br>
In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are <font color=green><b>paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends</b></font> than they <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> historically.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0097 (line 30, ant tvng):</b><br>
"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," Mr. Maughan said. "The real difference seems to be that the cash market here . . . is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn't <font color=green><b>having</b></font> the same impact it <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> in America."</p>
