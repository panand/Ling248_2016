It <font color=green><b>argues</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> Unice, that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0728 (line 13, ant vp):</b><br>
If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would <font color=green><b>select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk</b></font>, as I am sure your pros <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0742 (line 16, ant vp):</b><br>
Like others, Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks, they will <font color=green><b>move away from stocks</b></font> -- as many have already <font color=blue><b>done</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0747 (line 7, ant vped):</b><br>
He has not <font color=green><b>changed</b></font>, but those around him <font color=blue><b>have</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0749 (line 15, ant vp):</b><br>
The football and basketball players <font color=green><b>spent more time</b></font> on their sports in season than they <font color=blue><b>did</b></font> on class attendance and homework combined (30 hours a week versus 25.3).</p>
<p><b>wsj_0749 (line 18, ant vp):</b><br>
But even those numbers don't <font color=green><b>describe the situation as well</b></font> as the athletes <font color=blue><b>do</b></font> in their own words.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0755 (line 3, ant vp):</b><br>
Environmental concerns are beginning to <font color=green><b>have as much influence in oil-industry spending plans</b></font> as the price of crude <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0758 (line 18, ant vp):</b><br>
Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and <font color=green><b>shouted at the top of their lungs</b></font>.<br>
Mr. Engelken was <font color=blue><b>doing</b></font> the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the Passaic-Clifton National Bank, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0764 (line 14, ant vped):</b><br>
Journalists and their families are <font color=green><b>constantly threatened</b></font> as <font color=blue><b>are</b></font> the newspaper distribution outlets.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 27, ant vp):</b><br>
In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will <font color=green><b>give away the store</b></font>, but I can assure you I <font color=blue><b>will</b></font> not," he says. "I am aware we have real budgetary problems."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 46, ant vpng):</b><br>
Rather than <font color=green><b>scaring off white voters</b></font>, as many predicted he <font color=blue><b>would</b></font>, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. (Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority: On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day.)</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 55, ant vped):</b><br>
Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have <font color=green><b>been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years</b></font> as Mr. Dinkins <font color=blue><b>has</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 65, ant vp):</b><br>
Mr. Sutton recalls: "When I left, I sat down with Charlie {Rangel}, Basil {Paterson} and David, and David said, 'Who will <font color=green><b>run for borough president</b></font>? ' And I said, 'You <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>. '"</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 109, ant vp):</b><br>
If she <font color=green><b>remains influential with Mr. Dinkins</b></font>, as some suggest she <font color=blue><b>will</b></font>, his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0765 (line 111, ant ap):</b><br>
But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal, who would head a Dinkins transition team, is more <font color=green><b>mainstream</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> real-estate executive Anthony Gliedman, another insider.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0766 (line 33, ant vp):</b><br>
Ms. Johnson, who works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force. "It really brings you down to a human level," she says. "It's hard to <font color=green><b>accept all the suffering people are going through</b></font>, but you have <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0766 (line 34, ant vp):</b><br>
Ms. Johnson, who works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force. "It really brings you down to a human level," she says. "It's hard to <font color=green><b>accept all the suffering people are going through</b></font>, but you have to.<br>
If you <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>n't, you can't do your job."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0766 (line 82, ant vp):</b><br>
Recently, a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist. "I <font color=green><b>owe that contractor</b></font>.<br>
I really <font color=blue><b>do</b></font>," she says.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0768 (line 52, ant vp):</b><br>
And then, asset values of the funds could <font color=green><b>plunge</b></font> more than they <font color=blue><b>have</b></font> so far.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0771 (line 39, ant vp):</b><br>
But wouldn't a president who acted despite Senate objections <font color=green><b>be taking grave political risks</b></font>? "He <font color=blue><b>would</b></font>," agrees the chairman. "But that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0783 (line 20, ant vpng):</b><br>
I believe we have to take a shot at <font color=green><b>getting as much done</b></font> as we <font color=blue><b>can</b></font> through the court, through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0787 (line 33, ant vp):</b><br>
The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder <font color=green><b>wanted</b></font> but Mr. Breeden <font color=blue><b>does</b></font>n't.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0788 (line 61, ant ap):</b><br>
The markets are <font color=green><b>complex</b></font>, as <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> the environment in which they function.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0790 (line 29, ant vp):</b><br>
We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "`God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings, ' he tells his worried mother." Hassan <font color=green><b>comes to a bad end</b></font>, but so <font color=blue><b>does</b></font> almost everyone else in the book.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0790 (line 31, ant ap):</b><br>
If the setting is exotic, the prose is <font color=green><b>closer</b></font> to Balzac's "Pere Goriot" than it <font color=blue><b>is</b></font> to "Arabian Nights." Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic, and he modeled his work on Western classics.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0790 (line 38, ant vped):</b><br>
By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had <font color=green><b>vanished or become twisted</b></font>, as it <font color=blue><b>has</b></font> in Said.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0790 (line 43, ant vpng):</b><br>
While the theme is <font color=green><b>compelling</b></font>, the plot and characters <font color=blue><b>are</b></font> not.</p>
<p><b>wsj_0795 (line 29, ant ap):</b><br>
He added: "Inflation is <font color=green><b>lower</b></font> than I think people expected it to <font color=blue><b>be</b></font>, and I think that's good news."</p>
<p><b>wsj_0799 (line 66, ant vpng):</b><br>
But we're not <font color=green><b>making as many {pyrotechnic devices}</b></font> as we used <font color=blue><b>to</b></font>."</p>
